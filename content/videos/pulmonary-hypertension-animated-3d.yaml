title: "Pulmonary hypertension Animated 3D"
description: "As we know, unlike the rest of the body, pulmonary arteries carry blood from the right #heart to the lungs. This is one reason #pulmonary #hypertension can be dangerous. The blood vessels in the lungs are narrowed, blocked or destroyed. The damage slows blood flow through the lungs, and blood pressure in the lung arteries rises. The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs. The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail."
