title: "Myopia and Hyperopia"
description: "#Myopia and #hyperopia are the two most common kinds of #astigmatism. These two forms of vision problems impact up to one-third of the population and can be addressed in a variety of methods, including corrective lenses and surgery. Myopia, or nearsightedness, occurs when the eyeball is somewhat longer from front to back than normal or the cornea has an abnormally steep shape. As a result, the light entering the eye focuses in front of the retina, resulting in blurred distance vision."
