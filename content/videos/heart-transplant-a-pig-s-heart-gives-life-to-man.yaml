title: "Heart Transplant: A Pig's Heart Gives Life to Man"
description: "For the first time, a human has been given a transplant of a pig's heart. One of the earliest subjects, known as Baby Fae, survived 21 days with a baboon's heart in 1984. Such transplants have fallen into disuse because the animal organs are usually rejected by their human host. The NHS says there is 'still some way to go before transplants of this kind become an everyday reality'. 'If it works, it could be a small number of years away.'"
