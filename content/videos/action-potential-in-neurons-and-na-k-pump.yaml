title: "Action potential in Neurons and NA+/K+ pump"
description: "In this video, we will look at the #action #potential in #nerve cells, and How sodium-potassium (NA+/K+) Pump works in Nerve cells? Learn More: https://ecgkid.com ____________________________________________________________________ The Na+/K+-pump is an electrogenic transmembrane ATPase found in the cell's outer plasma membrane. The Na+/K+-ATPase transports three sodium ions out of cells while transporting two potassium ions in. Both cations migrate in the opposite direction of their concentrat..."
