title: "Module 4: ECG Correlates - Linking Heart Mechanics to Electrical Signals"
description: "Ever wondered how those squiggly lines on an ECG actually reflect the real movements of the heart? In this episode, we decode the critical link between electrical signals and muscle response. Understand how every wave on the ECG — from P to T — represents a physical event in the cardiac cycle. This is where electrical theory meets clinical interpretation. ✅ What You’ll Learn in This Module: The real meaning behind the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave How electrical impulses trigger actual hear..."
