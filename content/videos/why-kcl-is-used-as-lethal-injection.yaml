title: "Why KCL is Used as Lethal Injection?"
description: "Blood potassium concentration was determined by ion-selective electrode measurement (range 3.0-150 mM). Blood was found positive for diazepam at a therapeutic level. Potassium concentration was 160.0 (cardiac) and 87.3 mM (femoral blood). results show that potassium concentration was significantly higher in heart blood Although KCl is quite safe when administered orally, it is lethal at 75-150 mg/kg IV. Injection of a lethal dose of KCl produces death by cardiac arrest. KCl eliminates the pota..."
