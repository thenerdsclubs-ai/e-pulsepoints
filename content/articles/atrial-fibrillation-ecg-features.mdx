## Understanding Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Recognition on ECG is essential for emergency medicine and cardiology practice.

## Classic ECG Features

### Primary Findings

1. **Irregularly Irregular Rhythm**
   - No discernible pattern to R-R intervals
   - Most distinctive feature

2. **Absent P Waves**
   - Replaced by fibrillatory waves
   - Variable morphology

3. **Narrow QRS Complex**
   - Unless aberrant conduction present
   - Rate typically 120-160 bpm (uncontrolled)

## Rate Classification

- **Slow AFib**: < 60 bpm
- **Controlled AFib**: 60-100 bpm
- **RVR (Rapid Ventricular Response)**: > 100 bpm

## Clinical Management

### Rate vs Rhythm Control

**Rate Control Options:**
- Beta-blockers (Metoprolol)
- Calcium channel blockers (Diltiazem)
- Digoxin

**Rhythm Control:**
- Cardioversion (chemical or electrical)
- Antiarrhythmic drugs

### Anticoagulation

**CHA2DS2-VASc Score** for stroke risk:

## AFib with RVR

Rapid ventricular response requires urgent treatment:
1. Assess hemodynamic stability
2. Consider synchronized cardioversion if unstable
3. Rate control medications if stable

## Conclusion

Recognizing atrial fibrillation on ECG is crucial for appropriate management and stroke prevention. Always assess rate, rhythm, and clinical stability.
