        Figure 1: Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (AWMI) - Characteristic ECG Pattern
    

    
### 🔑 Key Points at a Glance

    

        - **Heart Rate:** Variable, often with compensatory tachycardia

        - **Primary Significance:** Large area of myocardium at risk, LAD occlusion, highest risk of cardiogenic shock and mortality

        - **Key Management:** Immediate STEMI protocol: aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, anticoagulation, emergent PCI within 90 minutes

        - **Clinical Category:** Clinical

    

## Overview and Clinical Significance

Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (AWMI) represents a critical cardiac rhythm pattern that requires immediate recognition and intervention. Large area of myocardium at risk, LAD occlusion, highest risk of cardiogenic shock and mortality

Understanding this ECG finding is essential for emergency physicians, cardiologists, intensivists, and all healthcare providers involved in acute cardiac care. Early recognition and appropriate management can significantly impact patient outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications.

## ECG Characteristics and Recognition

    
### 📊 Diagnostic ECG Criteria

    

        - **ST elevation in V1-V4**
- **Reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads**
- **Q waves in anterior leads (if evolved)**
- **Possible new LBBB**

    

### Systematic ECG Analysis Approach

When analyzing any ECG, including suspected Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (AWMI), follow this systematic approach:

    - **Rate:** Calculate ventricular rate using the 300-150-100-75-60-50 rule or count QRS complexes in 6 seconds × 10

    - **Rhythm:** Assess regularity by measuring R-R intervals across the entire strip

    - **P Waves:** Identify presence, morphology, and relationship to QRS complexes

    - **PR Interval:** Measure from start of P wave to start of QRS (normal: 0.12-0.20 seconds or 3-5 small squares)

    - **QRS Complex:** Assess duration (normal: 
        Always assess hemodynamic stability FIRST - unstable patients require immediate intervention regardless of the specific ECG diagnosis
    

## Evidence-Based Management

### Acute Management Strategy

**Primary Treatment Approach:** Immediate STEMI protocol: aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, anticoagulation, emergent PCI within 90 minutes

### 🚨 Emergency Protocol - Time-Critical Actions

- Immediate ABC assessment (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)
- Attach continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain 12-lead ECG
- Establish large-bore IV access (×2) and check bedside glucose
- Administer supplemental oxygen if SpO₂ 
        Recommendations for management of Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (AWMI) are primarily supported by Level A evidence (multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses).
    

## Summary and Clinical Bottom Line

    
### 📋 Clinical Bottom Line

    
**Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (AWMI)** is characterized by st elevation in v1-v4 on ECG. Large area of myocardium at risk, LAD occlusion, highest risk of cardiogenic shock and mortality

    
**Primary management:** Immediate STEMI protocol: aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, anticoagulation, emergent PCI within 90 minutes

    
**Key takeaway:** This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment - time-critical intervention saves lives
