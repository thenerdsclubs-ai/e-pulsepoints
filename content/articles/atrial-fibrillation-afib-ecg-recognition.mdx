# Atrial Fibrillation: A Comprehensive Guide

## What is Atrial Fibrillation?

Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting over 6 million Americans. It's characterized by chaotic, disorganized atrial electrical activity where multiple electrical impulses fire simultaneously, causing the atria to quiver rather than contract effectively.

## ECG Characteristics

### Primary Features:
1. **Irregularly Irregular Rhythm** - The hallmark of AFib with completely unpredictable R-R intervals
2. **Absent P Waves** - Normal P waves are replaced by fibrillatory waves
3. **Fibrillatory (f) Waves** - Fine, irregular baseline oscillations best seen in leads V1 and II
4. **Narrow QRS Complexes** - Typically normal duration unless bundle branch block coexists
5. **Variable Ventricular Rate** - Usually 100-180 bpm when untreated

### Rate Classification:
- **Slow AFib**: 100 bpm (uncontrolled)

## Clinical Significance

### Hemodynamic Impact:
- **Loss of Atrial Kick**: Reduces cardiac output by 20-30%
- **Reduced Diastolic Filling**: Particularly problematic in heart failure
- **Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy**: Can develop with prolonged rapid rates

### Thromboembolic Risk:
- Blood stasis in left atrial appendage increases clot formation
- 5-fold increased stroke risk compared to sinus rhythm
- Risk stratified using CHA₂DS₂-VASc score

## Management

### Immediate Assessment:
1. Hemodynamic stability (BP, mental status, chest pain)
2. Stroke risk calculation (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score)
3. Rate vs rhythm control strategy

### Treatment:
- **Rate Control**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin
- **Rhythm Control**: Antiarrhythmics, cardioversion, ablation
- **Anticoagulation**: Based on stroke risk (DOAC or warfarin)

## Key Points
- AFib = irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves
- Always assess hemodynamic stability
- Stroke prevention is critical
- New-onset <48h may allow cardioversion
- Chronic AFib needs anticoagulation consideration
