### 🔑 Key Points at a Glance

    

        - **Heart Rate:** Usually sinus tachycardia

        - **Primary Significance:** Highly specific for large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, emergency condition

        - **Key Management:** Immediate echocardiography to assess for tamponade, prepare for urgent pericardiocentesis if hemodynamically unstable

        - **Clinical Category:** Clinical

    

## Overview and Clinical Significance

Electrical Alternans represents a critical cardiac rhythm pattern that requires immediate recognition and intervention. Highly specific for large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, emergency condition

Understanding this ECG finding is essential for emergency physicians, cardiologists, intensivists, and all healthcare providers involved in acute cardiac care. Early recognition and appropriate management can significantly impact patient outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications.

## ECG Characteristics and Recognition

    
### 📊 Diagnostic ECG Criteria

    

        - **Beat-to-beat alternating QRS amplitude**
- **Alternating QRS axis**
- **Low voltage QRS complexes**
- **Associated with pericardial effusion**

    

### Systematic ECG Analysis Approach

When analyzing any ECG, including suspected Electrical Alternans, follow this systematic approach:

    - **Rate:** Calculate ventricular rate using the 300-150-100-75-60-50 rule or count QRS complexes in 6 seconds × 10

    - **Rhythm:** Assess regularity by measuring R-R intervals across the entire strip

    - **P Waves:** Identify presence, morphology, and relationship to QRS complexes

    - **PR Interval:** Measure from start of P wave to start of QRS (normal: 0.12-0.20 seconds or 3-5 small squares)

    - **QRS Complex:** Assess duration (normal: 
        Always assess hemodynamic stability FIRST - unstable patients require immediate intervention regardless of the specific ECG diagnosis
    

## Evidence-Based Management

### Acute Management Strategy

**Primary Treatment Approach:** Immediate echocardiography to assess for tamponade, prepare for urgent pericardiocentesis if hemodynamically unstable

### 🚨 Emergency Protocol - Time-Critical Actions

- Immediate ABC assessment (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)
- Attach continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain 12-lead ECG
- Establish large-bore IV access (×2) and check bedside glucose
- Administer supplemental oxygen if SpO₂ 
        Recommendations for management of Electrical Alternans are primarily supported by Level A evidence (multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses).
    

## Summary and Clinical Bottom Line

    
### 📋 Clinical Bottom Line

    
**Electrical Alternans** is characterized by beat-to-beat alternating qrs amplitude on ECG. Highly specific for large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, emergency condition

    
**Primary management:** Immediate echocardiography to assess for tamponade, prepare for urgent pericardiocentesis if hemodynamically unstable

    
**Key takeaway:** This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment - time-critical intervention saves lives
