### 🔑 Key Points at a Glance

    

        - **Heart Rate:** Variable

        - **Primary Significance:** Circumflex artery occlusion, can be subtle on ECG, high-lateral MI has worse prognosis

        - **Key Management:** STEMI protocol: emergent cardiac catheterization, dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, reperfusion therapy

        - **Clinical Category:** Clinical

    

## Overview and Clinical Significance

Lateral Wall Myocardial Infarction represents a critical cardiac rhythm pattern that requires immediate recognition and intervention. Circumflex artery occlusion, can be subtle on ECG, high-lateral MI has worse prognosis

Understanding this ECG finding is essential for emergency physicians, cardiologists, intensivists, and all healthcare providers involved in acute cardiac care. Early recognition and appropriate management can significantly impact patient outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications.

## ECG Characteristics and Recognition

    
### 📊 Diagnostic ECG Criteria

    

        - **ST elevation in I, aVL, V5-V6**
- **Reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads**
- **Q waves in lateral leads (if evolved)**
- **Possible T wave inversions**

    

### Systematic ECG Analysis Approach

When analyzing any ECG, including suspected Lateral Wall Myocardial Infarction, follow this systematic approach:

    - **Rate:** Calculate ventricular rate using the 300-150-100-75-60-50 rule or count QRS complexes in 6 seconds × 10

    - **Rhythm:** Assess regularity by measuring R-R intervals across the entire strip

    - **P Waves:** Identify presence, morphology, and relationship to QRS complexes

    - **PR Interval:** Measure from start of P wave to start of QRS (normal: 0.12-0.20 seconds or 3-5 small squares)

    - **QRS Complex:** Assess duration (normal: 
        Always assess hemodynamic stability FIRST - unstable patients require immediate intervention regardless of the specific ECG diagnosis
    

## Evidence-Based Management

### Acute Management Strategy

**Primary Treatment Approach:** STEMI protocol: emergent cardiac catheterization, dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, reperfusion therapy

### 🚨 Emergency Protocol - Time-Critical Actions

- Immediate ABC assessment (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)
- Attach continuous cardiac monitoring and obtain 12-lead ECG
- Establish large-bore IV access (×2) and check bedside glucose
- Administer supplemental oxygen if SpO₂ 
        Recommendations for management of Lateral Wall Myocardial Infarction are primarily supported by Level A evidence (multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses).
    

## Summary and Clinical Bottom Line

    
### 📋 Clinical Bottom Line

    
**Lateral Wall Myocardial Infarction** is characterized by st elevation in i, avl, v5-v6 on ECG. Circumflex artery occlusion, can be subtle on ECG, high-lateral MI has worse prognosis

    
**Primary management:** STEMI protocol: emergent cardiac catheterization, dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, reperfusion therapy

    
**Key takeaway:** This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment - time-critical intervention saves lives
