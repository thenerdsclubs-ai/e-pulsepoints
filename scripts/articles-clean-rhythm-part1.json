    "content": "# Atrial Fibrillation: A Comprehensive Guide\n\n## What is Atrial Fibrillation?\n\nAtrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting over 6 million Americans. It's characterized by chaotic, disorganized atrial electrical activity where multiple electrical impulses fire simultaneously, causing the atria to quiver rather than contract effectively.\n\n## ECG Characteristics\n\n### Primary Features:\n1. **Irregularly Irregular Rhythm** - The hallmark of AFib with completely unpredictable R-R intervals\n2. **Absent P Waves** - Normal P waves are replaced by fibrillatory waves\n3. **Fibrillatory (f) Waves** - Fine, irregular baseline oscillations best seen in leads V1 and II\n4. **Narrow QRS Complexes** - Typically normal duration unless bundle branch block coexists\n5. **Variable Ventricular Rate** - Usually 100-180 bpm when untreated\n\n### Rate Classification:\n- **Slow AFib**: <60 bpm (often on rate-control medications)\n- **Normal Rate AFib**: 60-100 bpm (controlled)\n- **Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR)**: >100 bpm (uncontrolled)\n\n## Clinical Significance\n\n### Hemodynamic Impact:\n- **Loss of Atrial Kick**: Reduces cardiac output by 20-30%\n- **Reduced Diastolic Filling**: Particularly problematic in heart failure\n- **Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy**: Can develop with prolonged rapid rates\n\n### Thromboembolic Risk:\n- Blood stasis in left atrial appendage increases clot formation\n- 5-fold increased stroke risk compared to sinus rhythm\n- Risk stratified using CHA₂DS₂-VASc score\n\n## Management\n\n### Immediate Assessment:\n1. Hemodynamic stability (BP, mental status, chest pain)\n2. Stroke risk calculation (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score)\n3. Rate vs rhythm control strategy\n\n### Treatment:\n- **Rate Control**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin\n- **Rhythm Control**: Antiarrhythmics, cardioversion, ablation\n- **Anticoagulation**: Based on stroke risk (DOAC or warfarin)\n\n## Key Points\n- AFib = irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves\n- Always assess hemodynamic stability\n- Stroke prevention is critical\n- New-onset <48h may allow cardioversion\n- Chronic AFib needs anticoagulation consideration",

    "content": "# Normal Sinus Rhythm: Understanding the Baseline\n\n## Definition\n\nNormal sinus rhythm (NSR) represents the heart's normal electrical conduction pattern, originating from the sinoatrial (SA) node located in the right atrium.\n\n## ECG Criteria for NSR\n\n### Essential Components:\n1. **Regular Rhythm**: Consistent R-R intervals (variation <10%)\n2. **Heart Rate**: 60-100 beats per minute\n3. **P Wave Morphology**:\n   - Upright in leads I, II, aVF\n   - Inverted in aVR\n   - Consistent shape and size\n4. **PR Interval**: 0.12-0.20 seconds (3-5 small squares)\n5. **P:QRS Ratio**: 1:1 (one P wave before each QRS)\n6. **QRS Duration**: <0.12 seconds (narrow complex)\n\n## Physiological Variations\n\n### Sinus Arrhythmia:\n- Normal variation with breathing\n- Rate increases with inspiration, decreases with expiration\n- Common in young, healthy individuals\n- P wave morphology stays consistent\n\n### Age-Related Normal Rates:\n- **Newborns**: 120-160 bpm\n- **Infants**: 100-150 bpm  \n- **Children**: 70-120 bpm\n- **Adults**: 60-100 bpm\n- **Athletes**: 40-60 bpm (sinus bradycardia)\n\n## Clinical Significance\n\nNSR indicates:\n- Normal SA node function\n- Intact AV conduction  \n- No significant electrolyte imbalances\n- No acute ischemia (if ST segments normal)\n\n## What NSR Doesn't Rule Out\n\nImportant: NSR does NOT exclude:\n- Valvular heart disease\n- Cardiomyopathy\n- Coronary artery disease (between episodes)\n- Heart failure\n- Pericardial disease\n\n## Key Teaching Points\n\n1. NSR requires ALL criteria - one abnormality changes diagnosis\n2. Rate alone doesn't define rhythm\n3. Sinus arrhythmia is normal, not pathological\n4. Always correlate ECG with clinical presentation\n5. NSR with ST changes may indicate ischemia\n\n## Practice Tips\n\n1. Start by identifying P waves\n2. Measure rate (300/large boxes method)\n3. Check regularity with calipers\n4. Verify P:QRS relationship\n5. Assess all intervals (PR, QRS, QT)",
